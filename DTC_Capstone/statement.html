        <h1>Statement</h1>
        <p class="statement">
            I chose the “Animal Shelter” as a topic because it is an issue in the
            whole world. I centered the information to the United States
            specifically since it is the current country we are in. </p> 
            <p class="statement"> 
            Stray animals are a big issue that needs attention from people and the
            animals need our help as they are constantly in danger due to our
            way of living. </p> 
            <p class="statement">
            Living in the city is not easy for them as they are
            exposed to car traffics, to diseases that can be transmitted from
            other animals, and overall they are vulnerable to everything not to
            mention the lack of care and love they deserve. </p> 
            <p class="statement"> 
            It is dangerous for them to live out there without a family to look out for them since
            there are human beings that want to hurt defenseless pets just
            because. Especially now that we are in the middle of a pandemic
            (COVID-19) people are even scared of stray animals and that they can
            bring in diseases which is not true. </p> 
            <p class="statement"> 
            As I stated on my infographic, adoption rate has decreased 36% since all this started and it is
            increasing. </p> 
            <p class="statement"> 
            People say that the shelters are empty but what that
            really means is that they do not have a pet that is ready to go home
            not that they do not have any pets. </p> 
            <p class="statement"> 
            I am hoping that my topic can open people’s eyes and heart to be more sensitive to the cause and
            help their local animal shelter and/or rescuers to give these little
            guys a chance to have a good life with a loving home.</p>
