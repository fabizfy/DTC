                    <h3>Adopting a pet?</h3>
                    <p>Adding a fury friend to the family is a life change for
                        you and for them. Imagine coming home and someone is
                        waiting happyly just to see you it is priceless.
                        Specially
                        during this pandamic it's been even harder for them to
                        find a home as the <b>adoption rate has decreased 36%</b>
                        compared to last year because of the temporary
                        restrictions and social distancing.</p>

                    <h3>Fostering a pet?</h3>
                    <p> Caring for a fury friend during this time is heroic!
                        Since the adoption process has been harder, the <b>animal
                            fostering system experienced an increased of 21%</b>.
                        This
                        is a great opportunity to help by giving a temporary
                        home
                        to them until they find their forever home! </p>
